        Neobrutalism components is a collection of type-safe components written
        in React and Tailwind.

        <br />
        Neobrutalism is a mix of regular brutalism in web design and more modern
        typography, illustration and animation standards. <br /> Neobrutalism
        refuses the usual components of UX-UI design and embraces uncomfortable
        design elements, and it is more fearless to use distinctive color
        palettes.
        <br />
        <br />I created this collection of components for people who want to
        learn more about neobrutalism style, and to help them get started with
        creating neobrutalism layouts.
